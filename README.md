## What is a Data Structure?
A data structure (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used (access and edit) effectively.

## Why Data Structure
1. They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
2. They help to manage and organize data.
3. They make code cleaner and easier to understand.

## Abstract Data Type vs Data Structure

### Abstract Data Type
An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.
The interaface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming languages.
